# Instanews

This project is a webpage that pulls news stories from the New York Times API.

## Learnings

This was my first time using APIs. Very versatile and powerful. I tried to start this project with grid as a basis and discovered that when there is outside content being pulled, it can be better to use flex. 

## Hurdles  

Again, grid was my first hurdle. I started coding before I actually planned out the format, and this caused me to restart several days in.

## Take aways

Planning. I really enjoy the inception and start of projects. I now pace myself a bit and make sure that I have a solid plan in place before diving into the code.
